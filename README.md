# PythonHackingStudy
An approach to hacking in python  in simple steps targeted on actual execution

Two different kali devices will be used, one where the host operating system is kali linux as the client and another where the host operating system in windows 8 with a virtual machine running kali as the server. The server machine has a exclusive wifi dongle it will be using to connect to a router on which the only other machine connected to that router will be the client machine. This is the scenario on which tests will occur. 

In some circumstances such as proxying or server compromization one machine will be used as a server of varying types regarding operating systems such as simple python sockets, red hat, or abyss, and protocols such asFTP or HTML. In other circumstances both machines will serve as clients where one monitors network traffic using the other client machine as proof of packet sniffing or the like.
